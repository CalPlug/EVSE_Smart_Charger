                    SmartFusion2 CorePWM duty cycle control example
================================================================================
This example demonstrates how to control the duty cycle of individual PWM outputs.
It slowly flashes a single LED.The LED slowly becomes brighter as the PWM duty cycle
increases and slowly dims as the duty cycle decreases

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sample project is targeted at a Cortex-M3 design running on the SmartFusion2
Eval Kit (090) board. The example project is built for a design using a 
SmartFusion2 MSS APB clock frequency of 25MHz. Trying to execute this example
project on a different design will result in incorrect time being used by CorePWM.
The design should have an instance of CorePWM version 4.3.101 located at 
address 0x50001000.

Make sure to set up following hardware configuration for running the current
example project:
   - One hardware instance of CorePWM should be created with 1 PWM Channel.
   - PWM outputs 1 should be connected to board LEDs via FPGA I/O pins.

This example is built to execute on an M2S090T die. You will need to overwrite
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with the
one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a newer silicon revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
