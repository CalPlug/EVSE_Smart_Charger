  @mainpage CorePWM Bare Metal Driver.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The CorePWM hardware IP which includes up to 16 pulse width modulated (PWM)
  outputs and up to 16 tachometer inputs. The CorePWM bare metal software
  driver is designed for use in systems with no operating system.

  The CorePWM driver provides:
    - Functions to control the duty cycle of each independent PWM output. The
      duty cycle control functions are identical for both the General Purpose
      PWM and Low Ripple DAC modes of CorePWM.
    - A function to control the positive and negative edges of each independent
      PWM output. This function can only be used for CorePWM outputs configured
      as General Purpose PWM. This function is useful for controlling the phase
      between different PWM outputs.
    - A function to generate left, center or right aligned PWM output waveforms.
    - Functions to enable and disable synchronous update of the PWM output
       waveforms.
    - Functions to enable and disable pulse stretching of the PWM output waveforms.
    - Functions to configure and control the tachometer and measure the period of
      tachometer input signals.
    - Functions to control tachometer interrupts.

  @section driver_configuration Driver Configuration
  The CorePWM driver is configured through calls to the PWM_init() function for
  each CorePWM instance in the hardware design. The configuration parameters
  include the CorePWM hardware instance base address and other runtime
  parameters, such as the PWM clock prescale and period.
  No CorePWM hardware configuration parameters are used by the driver, apart
  from the CorePWM hardware instance base address. Hence, no additional
  configuration files are required to use the driver.

  Configured PWM Register Widths
  Each CorePWM instance in the hardware design is configured for the width of the
  APB data bus, by the APB_DWIDTH configuration parameter. This parameter also
  configures the width of CorePWM’s PRESCALE, PERIOD, PWMx_POSEDGE, PWMx_NEGEDGE
  and DACx_LEVELOUT registers. The CorePWM driver’s PWM_init(),
  PWM_set_duty_cycle(), PWM_set_edges() and PWM_generate_aligned_wave() functions
  write values to these registers via one or more of the parameters prescale,
  period, duty_cycle, pos_edge or neg_edge – all of type uint32_t. It is your
  responsibility to ensure that the values passed by these parameters are within
  the range 0 to (2^APB_DWIDTH - 1), where APB_DWIDTH is 8, 16 or 32 dependent
  upon your CorePWM hardware configuration, The return value from the
  PWM_get_duty_cycle() function is also within the range 0 to (2^APB_DWIDTH - 1).

  Note: Failure to keep the prescale, period, duty_cycle, pos_edge and neg_edge
        parameter values within the range 0 to (2^APB_DWIDTH - 1) will result
        in unintended CorePWM register settings.

  Fixed PWM Peroid or Prescale Register Values
  The prescale and period parameter values passed to the PWM_init() function may
  not have any effect if fixed values were selected for the PRESCALE and PERIOD
  registers in the hardware configuration of CorePWM. When fixed values are
  selected for these registers, the driver cannot overwrite the fixed values.

  Fixed PWM Positive or Negative Edge Register Values
  The pos_edge and neg_edge parameter values passed to the PWM_set_edges()
  function, and the duty_cycle parameter value passed to the PWM_set_duty_cycle()
  and PWM_generate_aligned_wave() functions, may not have the desired effect if
  fixed values were selected for the PWMx_POSEDGE (positive edge) or
  PWMx_NEGEDGE (negative edge) registers in the hardware configuration of
  CorePWM. When fixed values are selected for these registers, the driver cannot
  overwrite the fixed values.

  Synchronized Update of PWM Output Waveforms
  The configuration of the CorePWM instance in the hardware design must enable
  the shadow update register for each PWM channel that requires synchronous output
  waveform updates. The PWM_enable_synch_update() and PWM_disable_synch_update()
  functions will only affect PWM channels that have their shadow update registers
  enabled in hardware.

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The CorePWM software driver is designed to allow the control of multiple
  instances of CorePWM. Each instance of CorePWM in the hardware design is
  associated with a single instance of the pwm_instance_t structure in the
  software.
  You need to allocate memory for one unique pwm_instance_t structure instance
  for each CorePWM hardware instance.The contents of these data structures are
  initialized during calls to function PWM_init(). A pointer to the structure
  is passed to subsequent driver functions in order to identify the CorePWM
  hardware instance you wish to perform the requested operation on.

  Note: Do not attempt to directly manipulate the content of pwm_instance_t
        structures. This structure is only intended to be modified by the driver
        function.

  Initialization
  The PWM granularity is configured through the PWM_init() function prescale
  parameter. The PWM granularity specifies the resolution of the PWM output
  waveforms for the targeted CorePWM instance. It is also sometimes called the
  PWM period count time base. It is defined by the following equation:
      PWM_GRANULARITY = SYS_CLOCK_PERIOD * ( prescale + 1 )
  Where SYS_CLOCK_PERIOD is the period of the system clock used to clock the
  CorePWM hardware instance and prescale is the value of the prescale parameter
  passed to function PWM_init().
  The PWM period is configured through the PWM_init() function period parameter.
  It specifies the period of the PWM output waveforms for the targeted CorePWM
  instance. The PWM period is defined by the following equation:
     PWM_PERIOD = PWM_GRANULARITY * ( period + 1 )

  Note: The prescale and period values passed to the PWM_init() function may not
        have any effect if fixed values were selected for the prescale and period
        in the hardware configuration of CorePWM.

  Note: The prescale and period parameters are not relevant to any PWM outputs
        that were configured for Low Ripple DAC mode in the hardware configuration
        of CorePWM. In this mode, their only role is in setting the interval between
        synchronized register updates when the shadow register is enabled for the
        PWM output.

  PWM Output Control
  The waveform for each PWM output is specified through calls to the
  PWM_set_duty_cycle() or PWM_set_edges() functions. Each PWM output is configured
  as either a General Purpose PWM output or a Low Ripple DAC output in the hardware
  configuration of CorePWM. In General Purpose PWM mode, either of the
  PWM_set_duty_cycle() or PWM_set_edges() functions may be used to specify the PWM
  output waveform. In Low Ripple DAC mode, only the PWM_set_duty_cycle() function
  may be used to specify the PWM output waveform. The duty cycle of the PWM can be
  read by calling PWM_get_duty_cyle().
  The waveform alignment of General Purpose PWM outputs can be set by calling
  PWM_generate_aligned_wave().
  The PWM_enable_synch_update() function is used to enable the synchronous update
  of a selected group of PWM channels. The PWM_disable_synch_update() is used to
  terminate the synchronous update cycle after at least one PWM period has elapsed.
  In synchronous mode the channel output waveforms are updated at the beginning of
  the PWM period, which is useful for motor control and can be used to keep a
  constant dead band space between channel waveforms. The configuration of the
  CorePWM instance in the hardware design must enable the shadow update register
  for each PWM channel that requires synchronous output waveform updates. When the
  shadow register is enabled, the PWM_set_duty_cycle(), PWM_set_edges() and
  PWM_generate_aligned_wave() functions set the new output waveform edge values in
  the channel’s shadow register instead of directly in the edge registers. Then, a
  call to the PWM_enable_synch_update() function updates the PWM channel’s output
  waveform at the beginning of the next PWM period. Finally, a call to the
  PWM_disable_synch_update() function completes the update cycle.

  Note: The PWM_enable_synch_update() and PWM_disable_synch_update() functions have
        no affect on any PWM channels that do not have their shadow update registers
        configured in hardware; these channels are always updated immediately,
        asynchronous to the PWM period.

  Note: The pos_edge and neg_edge values passed to the PWM_set_edges() function,
        and the duty_cycle value passed to the PWM_set_duty_cycle() and
        PWM_generate_aligned_wave() functions, may not have the desired effect if
        fixed values were selected for the positive or negative edge registers in
        the hardware configuration of CorePWM.

  A typical sequence of function calls for PWM outputs is:
  a call to function PWM_init() to initialize the CorePWM instance and pass it
  values for the prescale and period; a call to either PWM_set_duty_cycle() or
  PWM_set_edges() , or PWM_generate_aligned_wave() for each PWM output to specify
  the output waveform; a call to PWM_enable() to enable a PWM output; and a call to
  PWM_disable() to disable a PWM output.The function PWM_set_duty_cycle() and
  PWM_generate_aligned_wave() will also enable the PWM output if it is not already
  enabled.

  Tachometer Control
  CorePWM also provides a tachometer interface. During the hardware design, the
  CorePWM configuration mode should be set to either 1 - (PWM and TACH mode) or
  2 - (TACH only mode) which enables the tachometer interface. Each CorePWM hardware
  instance supports up to 16 tachometer inputs.
  The CorePWM tachometer is initialized through a call to the PWM_tach_init() function.
  The PWM_tach_init() function should be called before any other CorePWM driver
  tachometer functions to set up the tachometer prescale value, initialize the
  measurement mode and disable interrupts.
  The PWM_tach_set_mode() function is used to configure the tachometer input channels
  for continuous or one time measurement of the input signal period. The
  PWM_tach_clear_status() and PWM_tach_read_status() functions are used to clear and
  read the measurement status bits for the tachometer input channels. When the status
  bit indicates that a new input signal period measurement is available, the
  PWM_tach_read_value() function is used to read the measured signal period value.

  A typical sequence of function calls for measurement of a tachometer input signal is:
  a call to function PWM_init() to initialize the CorePWM instance and pass it values
  for the prescale and period; a call to PWM_tach_init() to initialize a tachometer
  input and pass it a tachometer prescale value; a call to PWM_tach_set_mode() to set
  the tachometer measurement mode; next a call to PWM_tach_enable_irq(), if interrupts
  are required; then a call to PWM_enable_stretch_pulse() to enable pulse stretching of
  the PWM output; a call to PWM_tach_clear_status() to trigger new measurement of the
  tachometer input signal period; a call to PWM_tach_read_status(), if interrupts are
  not used, to verify that input period value has been updated in the TACHPULSEDUR
  register; now a call to PWM_tach_read_value() to read the measured period of tachometer
  input signal; and finally a call to PWM_disable_stretch_pulse() to disable pulse
  stretching of the PWM output and resume a previously programmed PWM output waveform
  pattern.

  Interrupt Control
  Interrupts generated by CorePWM tachometer status changes are controlled using the
  following functions:
    - PWM_tach_enable_irq()
    - PWM_tach_disable_irq()
    - PWM_tach_clear_irq()
    - PWM_tach_get_irq_source()
  The PWM_tach_get_irq_source() function is used identify which CorePWM tachometer
  input channel has generated an interrupt, among all the tachometer input channels
  that have interrupts enabled.

  Note: If you specify the same value for both the positive edge and the

  The PWM_get_duty_cycle() function returns the current duty cycle of the
  specified PWM output. The duty cycle corresponds to the number of period
  ticks during which the output remains high and should be between 0 and the
  value of the period selected for the call to PWM_init().

  Note: Duty Cycle (in %) can be calculated as follows:
        Duty Cycle (%) = ( (returned duty cycle value) / (period +1) )*100

  Note: The PWM_get_duty_cycle() function is intended to return the duty cycle
        previously set through calls to the PWM_set_duty_cycle() or
        PWM_generate_aligned_wave() functions.

  Note: A returned duty cycle value of 0 normally means a 0% duty cycle. However,
        the PWM_get_duty_cycle() function will also return the value 0 when it
        is called after using the PWM_set_edges() function to set the PWM output
        waveform to toggle mode. In this case a return value of 0 does not mean
        a 0% duty cycle; rather it means that the PWM output waveform is in
        toggle mode. Refer to the description of the PWM_set_edges() function
        for a description of toggle mode. You must be alert to this exception if
        you use the PWM_set_edges() function to manipulate the PWM output
        waveform edges.

  @param pwm_inst
    Pointer to a pwm_inst structure holding all relevant data associated with
    the target CorePWM hardware instance. This pointer is used to identify the
    target CorePWM hardware instance.

  @param pwm_id
    The pwm_id parameter identifies the target PWM output.

  @return
    This function returns the duty cycle of the PWM output as a 32 bit unsigned
    integer. The duty cycle is the number of period ticks during which the
    output is high.

    Note: A returned duty cycle value of 0 normally means the PWM output is
          constantly low, however it may also indicate that the PWM output
          waveform is set to toggle mode (50% duty cycle). Refer to the note
          in the function description.

  Example:
  Read and assigns current duty cycle value to a variable.

  The PWM_generate_aligned_wave() function is used to align the duty_cycle of
  the PWM output waveform within the period of the PWM output waveform.
  Three PWM output waveform alignment options are supported:
    Left Aligned Waveform
    Center Aligned Waveform
    Right Aligned Waveform
  The PWM_generate_aligned_wave() function sets the appropriate positive edge
  and negative edge values to achieve the specified alignment for the PWM output

  Note: It will also enable the PWM output if it is not already enabled.

  The diagram below shows the possible waveform alignments:

  The PWM_enable_stretch_pulse() function is used to enable pulse stretching
  for the specified PWM output. To accurately measure the speed of 3-wire fans,
  it is necessary to turn on the fan periodically for long enough to get a
  complete measurement of the tachometer signal from the fan. This stretching
  of the PWM output pulse for a long duration is referred as PWM pulse
  stretching. When pulse stretching is enabled, the PWM output is set to high
  or low, dependent upon the configuration of the CorePWM instance in the
  hardware design. The PWM_disable_stretch_pulse() function must be used to
  disable PWM pulse stretching once the fan speed measurement is completed.

  Note: The configuration of the CorePWM instance in the hardware design must
        select the PWM output level – high or low – that is set when PWM pulse
        stretching is enabled. For example, to measure 3- wire fan speed, the
