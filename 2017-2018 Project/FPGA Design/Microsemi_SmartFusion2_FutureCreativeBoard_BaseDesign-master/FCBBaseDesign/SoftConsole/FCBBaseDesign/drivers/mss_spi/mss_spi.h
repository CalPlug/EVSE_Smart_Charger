  @mainpage SmartFusion2 MSS SPI Bare Metal Driver.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The SmartFusion2 microcontroller subsystem (MSS) includes two serial
  peripheral interface (SPI) peripherals for serial communication. This driver
  provides a set of functions for controlling the MSS SPIs as part of a bare
  metal system where no operating system is available. These drivers can be
  adapted for use as part of an operating system, but the implementation of the
  adaptation layer between this driver and the operating system's driver model
  is outside the scope of this driver.
    
  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
  The configuration of all features of the MSS SPI peripherals is covered by
  this driver with the exception of the SmartFusion2 IOMUX configuration.
  SmartFusion2 allows multiple non-concurrent uses of some external pins through
  IOMUX configuration. This feature allows optimization of external pin usage by
  assigning external pins for use by either the microcontroller subsystem or the
  FPGA fabric. The MSS SPI serial signals are routed through IOMUXs to the
  SmartFusion2 device external pins. The MSS SPI serial signals may also be
  routed through IOMUXs to the SmartFusion2 FPGA fabric. 
  The IOMUXs are configured using the SmartFusion2 MSS configurator tool. You
  must ensure that the MSS SPI peripherals are enabled and configured in the
  SmartFusion2 MSS configurator if you wish to use them. For more information on
  IOMUXs, refer to the IOMUX section of the SmartFusion2 Microcontroller
  Subsystem (MSS) User’s Guide.
  The base address, register addresses and interrupt number assignment for the
  MSS SPI peripherals are defined as constants in the SmartFusion2 CMSIS HAL.
  You must ensure that the latest SmartFusion2 CMSIS HAL is included in the
  project settings of the software tool chain used to build your project and
  that it is generated into your project.
  
  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The MSS SPI driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    - Initialization
    - Configuration for either master or slave operations
    - SPI master frame transfer control
    - SPI master block transfer control
    - SPI slave frame transfer control
    - SPI slave block transfer control
    - DMA block transfer
  Frame transfers allow the MSS SPI to write or read up to 32 bits of data in a
  SPI transaction. For example, a frame transfer of 12 bits might be used to
  read the result of an ADC conversion from a SPI analog to digital converter.
  Block transfers allow the MSS SPI to write or read a number of bytes in a SPI
  transaction. Block transfer transactions allow data transfers in multiples of
  8 bits (8, 16, 24, 32, 40…). Block transfers are typically used with byte
  oriented devices like SPI FLASH devices.
  
  Initialization 
  The MSS SPI driver is initialized through a call to the MSS_SPI_init()
  function. The MSS_SPI_init() function takes only one parameter, a pointer to
  one of two global data structures used by the driver to store state
  information for each MSS SPI. A pointer to these data structures is also used
  as first parameter to any of the driver functions to identify which MSS SPI
  will be used by the called function. The names of these two data structures
  are g_mss_spi0 and g_mss_spi1. Therefore any call to an MSS SPI driver
  function should be of the form MSS_SPI_function_name( &g_mss_spi0, ... ) or
  MSS_SPI_function_name( &g_mss_spi1, ... ).
  The MSS_SPI_init() function resets the specified MSS SPI hardware block and
  clears any pending interrupts from that MSS SPI in the Cortex-M3 NVIC.
  The MSS_SPI_init() function must be called before any other MSS SPI driver
  functions can be called.
  
  Configuration
  An MSS SPI block can operate either as a master or slave SPI device. There are
  two distinct functions for configuring a MSS SPI block for master or slave
  operations.
  
  Master configuration
  The MSS_SPI_configure_master_mode() function configures the specified MSS SPI
  block for operations as a SPI master. It must be called once for each remote
  SPI slave device which the MSS SPI block will communicate with. It is used to
  provide the following information about each SPI slave’s communication
  characteristics:
    - The SPI protocol mode
    - The SPI clock speed
    - The frame bit length
  This information is held by the driver and will be used to alter the
  configuration of the MSS SPI block each time a slave is selected through a
  call to MSS_SPI_set_slave_select(). The SPI protocol mode defines the initial
  state of the clock signal at the start of a transaction and which clock edge
  will be used to sample the data signal (Motorola SPI modes), or it defines
  whether the SPI block will operate in Texas Instruments (TI) synchronous
  serial mode or in National Semiconductor (NSC) MICROWIRE mode.
  
  Slave configuration
  The MSS_SPI_configure_slave_mode() function configures the specified MSS SPI
  block for operations as a SPI slave. It configures the following SPI
  communication characteristics:
    - The SPI protocol mode 
    - The frame bit length
  The SPI protocol mode defines the initial state of the clock signal at the
  start of a transaction and which clock edge will be used to sample the data
  signal (Motorola SPI modes), or it defines whether the SPI block will operate
  in TI synchronous serial mode or in NSC MICROWIRE mode.
  
  SPI master frame transfer control
  The following functions are used as part of SPI master frame transfers:
    - MSS_SPI_set_slave_select()
    - MSS_SPI_transfer_frame()
    - MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select()
  The master must first select the target slave through a call to
  MSS_SPI_set_slave_select(). This causes the relevant slave select line to
  become asserted while data is clocked out onto the SPI data line.
  A call is then made to MSS_SPI_transfer_frame() specifying the value of the
  data frame to be sent.
  The function MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select() can be used after the transfer is
  complete to prevent this slave select line from being asserted during
  subsequent SPI transactions. A call to this function is only required if the
  master is communicating with multiple slave devices.
  
  SPI master block transfer control
  The following functions are used as part of SPI master block transfers:
    - MSS_SPI_set_slave_select()
    - MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select()
    - MSS_SPI_transfer_block()
  The master must first select the target slave through a call to
  MSS_SPI_set_slave_select(). This causes the relevant slave select line to
  become asserted while data is clocked out onto the SPI data line.
  A call is then made to MSS_SPI_transfer_block (). The parameters of
  this function specify:
    - the number of bytes to be transmitted
    - a pointer to the buffer containing the data to be transmitted
    - the number of bytes to be received
    - a pointer to the buffer where received data will be stored
  The number of bytes to be transmitted can be set to zero to indicate that the
  transfer is purely a block read transfer. Alternatively, the number of bytes to
  be received can be set to zero to specify that the transfer is purely a block
  write transfer.
  The function MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select() can be used after the transfer is
  complete to prevent this slave select line from being asserted during
  subsequent SPI transactions. A call to this function is only required if the
  master is communicating with multiple slave devices.
  Note: Unlike in previous versions of this driver, the SPS bit is set in the
        CONTROL register in Motorola modes so that the Slave Select line remains
        asserted throughout block transfers.
 
  SPI slave frame transfer control
  The following functions are used as part of SPI slave frame transfers:
    - MSS_SPI_set_slave_tx_frame()
    - MSS_SPI_set_frame_rx_handler()
  The MSS_SPI_set_slave_tx_frame() function specifies the frame data that will
  be returned to the SPI master. The frame data specified through this function
  is the value that will be read over the SPI bus by the remote SPI master when
  it initiates a transaction. A call to MSS_SPI_set_slave_tx_frame() is only
  required if the MSS SPI slave is the target of SPI  read transactions, i.e. if
  data is meant to be read from the SmartFusion2 device over SPI.
  The MSS_SPI_set_frame_rx_handler() function specifies the receive handler
  function that will called when a frame of data has been received by the MSS
  SPI when it is configured as a slave. The receive handler function specified
  through this call will process the frame data written, over the SPI bus, to
  the MSS SPI slave by the remote SPI master. The receive handler function must
  be implemented as part of the application. It is only required if the MSS SPI
  slave is the target of SPI frame write transactions.
  Successive master writes need to take into account the time taken to execute
  the receive handler if the interface is to work reliably.
  SPI slave block transfer control
  The following functions are used as part of SPI slave block transfers:
    - MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers()
    - MSS_SPI_set_cmd_handler()
    - MSS_SPI_set_cmd_response()
  The MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers() function is used to configure a MSS SPI
  slave for block transfer operations. It specifies:
    - The buffer containing the data that will be returned to the remote SPI
      master
    - The buffer where data received from the remote SPI master will be stored
    - The handler function that will be called after the receive buffer has been
      filled
  The MSS_SPI_set_cmd_handler() function specifies a command handler function
  that will be called by the driver once a specific number of bytes has been
  received after the SPI chip select signal becoming active. The number of bytes
  making up the command part of the transaction is specified as part of the
  parameters to MSS_SPI_set_cmd_handler(). The command handler function
  is implemented as part of the application making use of the SPI driver and
  would typically call the MSS_SPI_set_cmd_response() function.
  The MSS_SPI_set_cmd_response() function specifies the data that will be
  returned to the master. Typically the MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers() will
  have been called as part of the system initialization to specify the data sent
  to the master while the command bytes are being received. The transmit buffer
  specified through the call to MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers() would also
  typically include one or more bytes allowing for the turnaround time required
  for the command handler function to execute and call MSS_SPI_set_cmd_response().
  
  DMA block transfer control
  The following functions are used as part of MSS SPI DMA transfers:
    - MSS_SPI_disable()
    - MSS_SPI_set_transfer_byte_count()
    - MSS_SPI_enable()
    - MSS_SPI_tx_done()
  The MSS SPI must first be disabled through a call to function
  MSS_SPI_disable(). The number of bytes to be transferred is then set through a
  call to MSS_SPI_set_transfer_byte_count(). The DMA transfer is then initiated
  by a call to the MSS_PDMA_start() function provided by the MSS PDMA driver.
  The actual DMA transfer will only start once the MSS SPI block has been
  re-enabled through a call to  MSS_SPI_enable(). The completion of the DMA
  driven SPI transfer can be detected through a call to MSS_SPI_tx_done(). The
  direction of the SPI transfer, write or read, depends on the DMA channel
  configuration. A SPI write transfer occurs when the DMA channel is configured
  to write data to the MSS SPI block. A SPI read transfer occurs when the DMA
  channel is configured to read data from the MSS SPI block.

  @param cmd_buffer
    The cmd_buffer parameter is a pointer to the buffer containing the data that

    can be null (0) if the master does not need to send a command before reading
    data or if the command part of the transfer is written to the SPI hardware
    block using DMA.
 
  @param cmd_byte_size
    The cmd_byte_size parameter specifies the number of bytes contained in
    cmd_buffer that will be sent. A value of 0 indicates that no data needs to
    be sent to the slave. A non-zero value while the cmd_buffer pointer is 0 is
    used to indicate that the command data will be written to the SPI hardware
    block using DMA.
 
  @param rd_buffer
    The rd_buffer parameter is a pointer to the buffer where the data received
    from the slave after the command has been sent will be stored.
 
  @param rd_byte_size
    The rd_byte_size parameter specifies the number of bytes to be received from
    the slave and stored in the rd_buffer. A value of 0 indicates that no data
    is to be read from the slave. A non-zero value while the rd_buffer pointer
    is null (0) is used to specify the receive size when using DMA to read from
    the slave. 
    Note:   When using DMA, all bytes received from the slave, including the

  DMA transfer example:
  In this example the transmit and receive buffers are not specified as part of
  the call to MSS_SPI_transfer_block(). MSS_SPI_transfer_block() will only
  prepare the MSS SPI hardware for a transfer. The MSS SPI transmit hardware
  FIFO is filled using one DMA channel and a second DMA channel is used to read

  transfers on the channel used for transmit data and the channel used for
  receive data.

      based on the content of the receive data buffer.
    - Slave returning a block of data to the master. The type of information is
      always the same but the actual values change over time. For example,
      returning the voltage of a predefined set of analog inputs.
    - Slave returning data based on a command contained in the first part of the
      SPI transaction. For example, reading the voltage of the analog input
      specified by the first data byte by the master. This is achieved by using
      the MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers() function in conjunction with
      functions MSS_SPI_set_cmd_handler() and MSS_SPI_set_cmd_response(). Please
      refer to the MSS_SPI_set_cmd_handler() function description for details of
      this use case.
  
  @param this_spi
    The this_spi parameter is a pointer to an mss_spi_instance_t structure
    identifying the MSS SPI hardware block to operate on. There are two such
    data structures, g_mss_spi0 and g_mss_spi1, associated with MSS SPI 0 and
    MSS SPI 1 respectively. This parameter must point to either the g_mss_spi0
    or g_mss_spi1 global data structure defined within the SPI driver.
 
  @param tx_buffer
    The tx_buffer parameter is a pointer to a buffer containing the data that
    will be sent to the master. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI
    slave is not intended to be the target of SPI read.
 
  @param tx_buff_size
    The tx_buff_size parameter specifies the number of bytes that will be
    transmitted by the SPI slave. It is the number of bytes contained in the
    tx_buffer. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI slave is not
    intended to be the target of SPI read transactions.
 
  @param rx_buffer
    The rx_buffer parameter is a pointer to the buffer where data received from
    the master will be stored. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI
    slave is not intended to be the target of SPI write or write-read
    transactions.
 
  @param rx_buff_size
    The rx_buff_size parameter specifies the size of the receive buffer. It is
    also the number of bytes that must be received before the receive handler
    is called, if a receive handler is specified using the block_rx_handler
    parameter. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI slave is not
    intended to be the target of SPI write or write-read transactions.
 
  @param block_rx_handler
    The block_rx_handler parameter is a pointer to a function that will be
    called when the receive buffer has been filled. This parameter can be set to
    0 if the MSS SPI slave is not intended to be the target of SPI write or
    write-read transactions.
 
  Slave performing operation based on master command:
  In this example the SPI slave is configured to receive 10 bytes of data or
  command from the SPI master and process the data received.

            ( 
                &g_mss_spi0,

                MSS_SPI_BLOCK_TRANSFER_FRAME_SIZE
            );
         
         MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers
             (
                 &g_mss_spi1,

                 0,
                 slave_rx_buffer,
                 sizeof(slave_rx_buffer),

             );
     }
  @endcode
  
  Slave responding to command example:
  In this example the slave will return data based on a two byte command sent by
  the master. The first part of the transaction involves the slave reading the
  command bytes sent by the remote SPI master. Once slave select is de-asserted
  the receive handler is called and the slave can process the command. The second
  part of the transaction, where the slave returns data based on the command value,
  is sent using a DMA transfer initiated from within the receive handler.
  
  The MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers() function specifies that two commands must
  be received from the master before the receive handler is called. A delay time
  must be defined in the application program to delay the master from initiating
  the second transfer to receive the response data from the MSS SPI slave until
  the receive handler has executed, determined the response data and set up the
  DMA transfer.

/***************************************************************************//**
  The MSS_SPI_set_cmd_handler() function specifies a command handler function
  that will be called when the number of bytes received reaches the command size
  specified as parameter.
  This function is used by SPI slaves performing block transfers. Its purpose is
  to allow a SPI slave to decide the data that will be returned to the master
  while a SPI transaction is taking place. Typically, one of more command bytes
  are sent by the master to request some specific data. The slave interprets the
  command byte(s) while one or more turn-around bytes are transmitted. The
  slave adjusts its transmit data buffer based on the command during the
  turnaround time.
  The diagram below provides an example of the use of this function where the
  SPI slave returns data bytes D0 to D6 based on the value of a command. The
  3 bytes long command is made up of a command opcode byte followed by an address
  byte followed by a size byte. The cmd_handler() function specified through an
  earlier call to MSS_SPI_set_cmd_handler() is called by the SPI driver once the
  third byte is received. The cmd_handler() function interprets the command bytes
  and calls MSS_SPI_set_cmd_response() to set the SPI slave's response transmit
  buffer with the data to be transmitted after the turnaround bytes (T0 to T3).
  The number of turnaround bytes must be sufficient to give enough time for the
  cmd_handler() to execute. The number of turnaround bytes is specified by the
  protocol used on top of the SPI transport layer, so both the master and slave
  must adhere to this.

                             implementation of cmd_handler() to set the data
                             that will be transmitted by the SPI slave.

  @param this_spi
    The this_spi parameter is a pointer to an mss_spi_instance_t structure
    identifying the MSS SPI hardware block used. There are two such data
    structures, g_mss_spi0 and g_mss_spi1, associated with MSS SPI 0 and MSS SPI
    1 respectively. This parameter must point to either the g_mss_spi0 or
    g_mss_spi1 global data structure defined within the SPI driver.

  @param cmd_handler
    The cmd_handler parameter is a pointer to a function with prototype:
        void cmd_handler(uint8_t * rx_buff, uint32_t rx_size);
    It specifies the function that will be called when the number of bytes
    specified by parameter cmd_size has been received.

    Passing in a null pointer for this disables the command handler and the
    associated interrupt.

 @param cmd_size
    The cmd_size parameter specifies the number of bytes that must be received
    before the command handler function specified by cmd_handler is called.
  
  The example below demonstrates how to configure SPI1 to implement the protocol
  given as example in the diagram above.
  The configure_slave() function configures SPI1. It sets the receive and transmit
  buffers. The transmit buffer specified through the call to
  MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers() specifies the data that will be returned to
  the master in bytes between t0 and t3. These are the bytes that will be sent
  to the master while the master transmits the command and dummy bytes.
  The spi1_slave_cmd_handler() function will be called by the driver at time t1
  after the 3 command bytes have been received.
  The spi1_block_rx_handler() function will be called by the driver at time t4
  when the transaction completes when the slave select signal becomes de-asserted.
