# Installation
---
Required tasks needed for the project: 

1.) Install Arduino ESP32 on Windows using this link: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/windows.md

2.) Install ADE7953-Wattmeter-master into Arduino library which can be found in the EVSE_Smart_Charger github. 
    Go to: EVSE code->Arduino->libraries->ADE7953-Wattmeter-master for ESP32.

3.) Use the library "esp32-hal-spi.h" for SPI. Can be obtained from doing the first task. 

# Building 
---
After following the steps for installation, you can start by creating an account on your desired MQTT broker for testing purposes. It comes in many types of flavors, but our personal favorite and recommendation is CloudMQTT. Go to this link: https://www.cloudmqtt.com/. After you have created your account, prepare to gather the mqtt user, password, port and server because you need these in order to connect with your server. You also need to prepare your desired network name and password. It is very important to note that the ESP32 is itself an access point initally and that you would need to create its own server where the user can input their own MQTT server and Network for the ESP32 to connect to. In the initial stages of testing your software without implementing the ESP32 as its own access point, you would need to hardcode the information you have gathered in the beginning. 

# Background of Operation 
---
The Smart Charger initializes inputs and safety checks. After the safety check passes, it tries to connect to the wifi available. Then after being connected to the wifi it connects to the mqtt server. Initially the charger is in state A which means it is not plugged in. When it is plugged in but not charging, the charger is in state B. The wattmeter reads values such as Vrms, Irms, and active power. When it changes to state C which is at charging state, both relays will turn on. Pressing the button at certain amount of times will turn off the load, change the load, reset, and enter AP mode.  

# Usage
---
Smart Charger can be used to monitor the charging conditions of an electric vehicle. Online, an EV owner will be able to have control over the charger, for example they may ask for voltage levels and will be able to change the load going into the vehicle. It will be very useful in time as the number of electric vehicle users increase.
