ESP32:
  Main Inputs:
    VP-GPIO36 and Vn-GPIO39
    (General Pin Input Output)
   ADC Pin can be reassigned to 12 other pins(adcAttachPin(pin). 
 
   ADC In/Out Graph
    - Has a linear region not totally linear.
    Functions-
      Control over resolution(analogReadResoulution(12)), width, cycles, samples, clock(default 1), attenuation(choose from 1.34, 1.5, 3.6), attachPin to choose 
      what pin to attach ADC to, functions to test the status of conversions + more..
      -ADC Range Default is 0-1V
       -ReadVoltage(pin)-Converts ADC to linear response when input is between 0-3V
 Timer Interrupts:
  -Alarms are generated by timers at specific value reached by counting up or down.
  -First need a global, volatile, variable for counter that is used by the interrupt service routine that only signals the interrupt but
    is handled by the main loop. This way counter is incremented accordingly even if interrupt hangs in mainloop.
    -Second counter tracks # of interrupts by mainloop
    -Pointer variable to setup arduino function
      -lastly a portMUX_type to sync betweeen main loop and interrupt service routine.
